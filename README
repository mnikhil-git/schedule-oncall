Schedule::Oncall is a Perl  module which provides methods to manipulate a
rotational on-call schedule.  One or more tables of schedules can be
maintained, loaded, and searched.  An on-call table is composed of seven days,
where each day has a list of minute ranges which correspond to a particular
person.

To install:

First install the Date::Manip module from http://www.perl.com/CPAN/

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

Then install this module:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

See the pod pages for Schedule::Oncall

There is an accompanying set of tools which use the Schedule::Oncall module
called "schedule-tools-(version).tar.gz" to generate various oncall reports,
send email, etc.

More documentation will be added at a later, since this is only the initial
release.

This module can be found in CPAN, or here:
