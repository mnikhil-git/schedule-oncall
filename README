To install:

Install the Date::Manip module from http://www.perl.com/CPAN/

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

See the pod pages for Schedule::Oncall

There is an accompanying set of tools which use the Schedule::Oncall module
called "schedule-tools-(version).tar.gz" to generate various oncall reports,
send email, etc.

More documentation will be added at a later, since this is only the initial
release.
